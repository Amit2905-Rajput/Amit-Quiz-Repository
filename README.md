Reflection
This project was about working with healthcare data to understand and prepare it for machine learning. First, the data was uploaded and checked to see what it looked like. Then, missing values were identified, and unnecessary columns like names and room numbers were removed. Some columns with text values, like gender or medical condition, were changed into numbers using one-hot encoding, which helps computers understand the data better.

After cleaning the data, it was split into training and testing sets to help build a model in the future. These steps are very important before creating any machine learning model. The work done shows a good understanding of data handling and preparation. To improve this project, adding a model and checking its performance would be helpful. This will show how well the data can be used to predict healthcare costs or other outcomes.
